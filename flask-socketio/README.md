# [Flask-SocketIO](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The command line interface based on click introduced in Flask 0.11 is also supported. This extension provides a new version of the flask run command that is appropriate for starting the Socket.IO server. Example usage:
```shell
$ FLASK_APP=app.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run
```
